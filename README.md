The goal for this application was to create a simple app to allow a user to set a goal weight they'd like to achieve, as well as have the ability to log their daily weights in an organized list.
The necessary screens for this were a login screen, and a home screen that contains the grids for the user to interact with the application.
I kept my UI design minimal, following a green and blue theme, as I believe this enhances the user's experience with the app by maintaining simplicity.
As to the process of coding, I first built the necessary functionality as basic as could be for early testing. Once these features were confirmed to work, I began implementing them into the UI to keep my original
goal of having the app appear easy to navigate. After all the basic features were created, I began implementing the database and building on to the first core features, taking breaks to test their functionality
at every step.
I tested my code by myself, as in I tried to do things the code wouldn't allow, such as creating a duplicate user. I also tested each function individually immediately upon its creation, this way I could be comfortable
in continuing on knowing that I wouldn't have to search long for an issue as it would be a new one rather than a prior existing issue.
